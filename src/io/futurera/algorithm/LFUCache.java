/**
 * Put your code in the inner LFUCache class. Design and implement a data
 * structure for Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache. It should support the
 * following operations: get and put.
 * 
 * get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key
 * exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
 * 
 * put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present.
 * When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least
 * frequently used item before inserting a new item. For the purpose of this
 * problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys that have the same
 * frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.
